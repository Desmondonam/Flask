# Flask

## Step 1: Installation and Setup

To begin, you'll need to install Python on your system if you haven't already. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and download the latest version compatible with your operating system.

Once Python is installed, you can install Flask using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

-- pip install flask

After there you can create an python file like app.py and then you can begin to create an application in flask.
